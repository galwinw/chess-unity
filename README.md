Chess game made with unity

Until now I have made...
- Working chess multiplayer, working with a AWS ec2 instance. 

Still need to implement...
- Better way for people to join the right game 

Bugs needed to fix...
- when I drag a piece and let go of mouse outside of the board the piece's tranfrom follows my mouse which can break my game in some instances
- WHen someone hosts twice in a row they get into a game by themselves.
