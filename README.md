Chess game made with unity

Until now I have made...
- working CHessboard, pieces, and mechanincs (You could play a local game of chess)

Still need to implement...
- Multiplayer
- Multiple Themes

Bugs needed to fix...
- when I drag a piece and let go of mouse outside of the board the piece's tranfrom follows my mouse which can break my game in some instances
